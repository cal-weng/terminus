## Introduction

Terminus OS is a free, self-hosted operating system built on Kubernetes. It is designed as a one-stop self-hosted solution for user-owned edge devices. Our goal is to enable users to securely store their most important data on their own hardware ad access services based on this private data from anywhere in the world. Typical use cases include：

- 💻 **Self-hosted**: Terminus OS serves as a one-stop self-hosted solution where users can host and manage their data, operations, and digital life effectively, with full data ownership.
- 🤖 **Local AI**: Build local AI agents with Terminus OS without writing code.
- 🤝 **User-owned decentralized social media**: Easily install decentralized social media apps such as Mastodon, Ghost, and WordPress on Terminus OS, allowing you to build a personal brand without the risk of being banned or paying platform commissions.

## Motivation and Design

We believe the current state of the internet, where user data is centralized and exploited by monopolistic corporations, is deeply flawed. Our goal is to empower individuals with true data ownership and control.

This vision is rooted in what we call the "BEC" (Blockchain, Edge, Client) model, where applications and data reside at the edge, secrets are stored on clients, identities on blockchain. By distributing data across personal Edge nodes rather than centralized servers, Terminus OS aims to restore user sovereignty over their digital information, communications, and online activities.  

As an instantiation of the BEC model, the Terminus ecosystem is composed of three integral components:

- **Snowinning Protocol**: A decentralized identity and reputation system that integrates decentralized identifiers (DIDs), verifiable credentials (VCs), and reputation data into blockchain smart contracts. Learn more in [documentation](https://docs.jointerminus.com/overview/snowinning/overview.html). 
  ![Snowinning Protocol](https://file.bttcdn.com/github/terminus/snowinning-protocol.jpg)
- **Terminus OS**: An one-stop self-hosted OS running on edge devices.  
  ![Tech Stacks](https://file.bttcdn.com/github/terminus/v2/tech-stack.jpeg)
- **TermiPass**: A comprehensive client software that operates across multiple platforms. It securely stores users' private keys and manages their identities and data across various Edge devices. Learn more in [documentation](https://docs.jointerminus.com/how-to/termipass/overview.html).


## Features

Terminus OS offers a wide array of features designed to enhance security, ease of use, and development flexibility:

- **Enterprise-grade security**: Simplified network configuration using Tailscale, Headscale, Cloudflare Tunnel, and FRP.
- **Secure and permissionless application ecosystem**: Sandboxing ensures application isolation and security.
- **Unified filesystem and database**: Automated scaling, backups, and high availability.
- **Single sign-on**: Log in once to access all applications within Terminus OS with a shared authentication service.
- **AI capabilities**: Comprehensive solution for GPU management, local AI model hosting, and private knowledge bases while maintaining data privacy.
- **Built-in applications**: Includes file manager, sync drive, vault, reader, app market, settings, and dashboard.
- **Seamless anywhere access**: Access your devices from anywhere using dedicated clients for mobile, desktop, and browsers.
- **Development tools**: Comprehensive development tools for effortless application development and porting.
