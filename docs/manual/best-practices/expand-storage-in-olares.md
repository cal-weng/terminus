# Expand storage in Olares

This document describes how to expand storage in Olares, including connecting to an SMB server, using automatically mounted USB storage devices, and manually mounting HDDs or SSDs from the Linux hosting environment.

## Connect to an SMB server

You can easily mount Server Message Block (SMB) shares in Olares to access and manage shared files.

1. On the Olares web interface, navigate to **Files** > **External** > **Connect to server**.

2. Enter the server address (for example: `//192.168.1.10/shared`) and click **Confirm**.

3. Once connected, you can access the shared directory under **Files** > **External**.

For details, please refer to [Mount SMB shares](../olares/files/mount-SMB.md).

## Expand storage via USB devices

**Olares** automatically detects and mounts inserted USB storage devices.

- Once you insert a USB device, it will be mounted automatically — no command-line operations are required.

- You can access it in **Files** > **External** from both Olares and Larepass.

- When the USB device is unplugged, the system automatically unmounts it.

## Manually mount an HDD or SSD

You can manually mount an HDD or SSD to Olares from your **Linux** hosting system.

This approach is recommended for **large data storage** (e.g., AI models) or **long-term storage expansion**.

### Before you begin

Please ensure the following:

- You have **administrator (sudo) privileges** on your Linux system.

- **Olares** is properly installed and running.

- The target drive is **already formatted** (recommended file systems: `ext4` or `XFS`).

:::tip  Mount path restriction

Currently, only mounts under the `/olares/share` directory are supported.

Mounting flexibility will be improved in future versions.
:::

### Identify the drive

1. Insert the hard drive into the host machine.

2. Run the following command to view detected drives:

   ```bash
   fdisk -l
   ```

3. Identify the target drive type and device name from the output:

    - **NVMe SSD**: typically appear as `/dev/nvme0n1`, `/dev/nvme1n1`, etc.
    - **SATA** or **HDD**: typically appear as `/dev/sda`, `/dev/sdb`, etc.

    Each drive lists its partitions under the Device column, such as `/dev/nvme1n1p1`, `/dev/nvme1n1p2`, or `/dev/sdb1`.

4. Confirm the target partition to mount (e.g., `/dev/nvme1n1p1`).

### Temporarily mount a partition

Temporary mounting is suitable for **one-time** or **short-term** use (e.g., file transfer).

The mount configuration will be lost after a Linux or Olares reboot.

1. Create a mount directory:

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir -p /olares/share/<directory_name>
    ```

    Replace `<directory_name>` with a custom name.

2. Mount the partition:

    ```bash
    sudo mount /dev/<partition> /olares/share/<directory_name>    
    ```

    **Example**:

    ```
    sudo mount /dev/nvme1n1p1 /olares/share/hdd0
    ```

3. Verify the mount result:

    After successful mounting, you can access the partition from **Files** > **External**.

### Permanently mount a partition

If you want the mount configuration to remain after reboot, configure **automatic mounting** in `/etc/fstab`.

1. Run the following command to list all drives and find the target partition:

    ```bash
    lsblk -f
    ```

    Record the following information:
    - **FSTYPE**: File system type (e.g., `ext4`, `xfs`).
    - **UUID**: Unique identifier of the partition.

    ![Check mount result](/images/manual/tutorials/expand-storage-fstype.png#bordered)

2. Create a mount directory:
    
    ```bash
    sudo mkdir -p /olares/share/<directory_name>
    ```

    Replace `<directory_name>` with a custom name.

3. Edit the mount configuration file:
    
    ```bash
    sudo vi /etc/fstab
    ```

4. Add a mount entry using **UUID** (recommended to prevent issues if device names change):

    ```
    UUID=<UUID> /olares/share/<directory_name> <FSTYPE> defaults,nofail 0 0
    ```

    **Example**:

    ```
    UUID=1234-ABCD /olares/share/my_disk ext4 defaults,nofail 0 0
    ```

5. Save and exit the editor.

6. Verify the configuration (recommended):

    ```bash
    mount -a
    ```
    
    If no errors appear, the setup is successful.

7. After reboot, confirm the drive is automatically mounted via **Files** > **External**.

    :::warning
    An incorrect /etc/fstab configuration may prevent your system from booting.
    It is strongly recommended to run `mount -a` first to validate the configuration before rebooting.
    :::

### Unmount a partition

You can unmount partitions mounted using either temporary or permanent methods.

1. Unmount the partition:

    ```bash
    sudo umount /olares/share/<directory_name>
    ```

    :::tip NOTE
    Make sure no programs or terminals are accessing the directory before unmounting.
    :::

2. Remove the empty directory (optional):

    ```bash
    rm -rf /olares/share/<directory_name>
    ```

    :::warning
    Ensure the directory is empty and fully unmounted before deleting.
    :::

    You can also view and remove this directory from **Files** in Olares.
