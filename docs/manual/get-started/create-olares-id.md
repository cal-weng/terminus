# Create Olares ID

An Olares ID is a unique identifier within the Olares ecosystem, serving as your digital identity and gateway to various services and features.

An Olares ID consists of a local name and a domain. For example, in `alice123@olares.com`:
- `alice123`: Local name
- `olares.com`: Domain name

## Download and install LarePass app

To get started with Olares, you'll need to download LarePass on your mobile device. LarePass is available for both Android and iOS platforms:

* **For Android users**: Install LarePass from the Google Play Store.
* **For iOS users**: Download LarePass from the App Store.

This section is dedicated to helping first-time users quickly create a personal Olares ID for immediate use. 

For advanced use cases, such as creating an Olares ID using your social account handle or setting up accounts for a team, refer to [Create accounts](../larepass/create-account.md).
:::

1. In the LarePass app, tap **Create an account**.
2. Enter your desired Olares ID. It must meet the following requirements:
   * never be registered before
   * at least 8 characters long
   * only lowercase letters and numbers
3. Click **Continue** to finish the creation process.

:::tip `.cn` vs. `.com` domains
To ensure the best connectivity and performance, Olares automatically assigns a domain based on your phone's system language and region.

If your phone's system language is set to Chinese, LarePass will assign a `.cn` domain. While functional, this may result in slower performance or DNS resolution issues outside of mainland China due to its specific routing.

To resolve this, please enter **Advanced account creation** mode <i class="material-symbols-outlined">display_settings</i> from the top-right corner of the LarePass account creation page, and switch the default domain to `.com`.
