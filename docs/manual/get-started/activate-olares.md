   b. Reset the login password for Olares by following the on-screen instructions on LarePass.

   ::: tip 
   If you reinstall Olares, the original instance becomes unavailable. To continue using the same Olares ID, you need to [reactivate Olares](../larepass/activate-olares.md#reactivate-olares-with-the-same-olares-id).
   :::

After setup is complete, the LarePass app returns to the home screen, and the Wizard redirects you to the Olares login page.
