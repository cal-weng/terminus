# Monitor system and application status
The Dashboard app in Olares provides a centralized and intuitive view of your system's status, offering deep insights without requiring extensive technical expertise. From the dashboard, you can monitor key resource usage patterns and access detailed real-time metrics across your cluster.

## Access monitoring dashboards

View your system's status through these specialized dashboards:
- **Overview**: Shows current resource usage and system health.
- **Applications**: Displays running applications and their status.

## Overview

The Overview page provides a comprehensive, at-a-glance view of your Olares system's health and resource utilization. It is divided into key sections to help you monitor performance effectively:

- Cluster's physical resources
- User resource usage
- Usage ranking


### View physical resources usage

Monitor the fundamental resource metrics directly from the **Cluster's physical resource** dashboard:

- CPU utilization
- Memory consumption
- Disk usage
- Pod status
- GPU usage
- Network status

![Dashboard overview](/images/manual/olares/dashboard-overview.png#bordered)
:::info Multi-node cluster display
When your cluster consists of multiple nodes:
- Overview panels: Display aggregate results across all nodes (e.g., CPU/memory usage, disk utilization, network traffic, overall GPU usage).
- Resource detail pages: Show metrics broken down per node, allowing you to analyze each node individually.
  :::

### Access detailed resource panels

For a deeper analysis of any resource, simply click on its card on the **Cluster's physical resources** dashboard. This navigates you to a dedicated detail panel with comprehensive monitoring data and metrics.

#### GPU panel

The **GPU** panel provides in-depth information about your GPUs within the cluster. Use this panel to effectively monitor GPU health, resource allocation, and performance across your cluster. 

To access it, click the GPU card on the **Cluster's physical resources** dashboard.

![GPU panel](/images/manual/olares/dashboard-gpu-overview.png#bordered)

This panel includes two tabs: 

- **Graphics management tab**: View a list of all detected GPUs, including their GPU ID, model, GPU mode (e.g., Memory Slicing), host node, health status, computing power usage, VRAM usage rate, and power draw.
  
  For a more granular view of a specific GPU, click **View details** next to its entry.

- **Task management tab**: Monitor tasks currently using your GPUs. It provides insights into the task name, status, GPU Mode, host node, computing power usage, and VRAM used, along with available operations.

#### Network panel

The Network panel provides comprehensive insights into your network interfaces. Use this panel to monitor network connectivity, traffic flow, and configuration for optimal system performance.

To access it, click the **Network** card on the **Overview** dashboard.

### Check user resource quota
You can view your resource quota allocated by the Olares admin.

![Resource quota](/images/manual/olares/resource-quota.png#bordered)

:::warning
When your resource quota runs low, you may experience:

* Slower system performance.
* Inability to install new applications.
* Automatic suspension of resource-intensive applications.
:::


### Track application performance
The **Usage ranking** section displays the top 5 applications consuming CPU and memory resources. To access the complete list of application resource usage, click **More**.

![Usage ranking](/images/manual/olares/usage-ranking.png#bordered)

## Applications

The **Applications** dashboard helps you monitor resource usage patterns across your applications through various sorting and filtering options.

Use the dropdown menu in the upper right corner to sort applications based on their resource consumption:
- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Inbound traffic
- Outbound traffic

![Applications](/images/manual/olares/applications.png#bordered)

Toggle between ascending and descending order to identify which applications are consuming the most or least resources.

For applications supporting multiple entrances (such as Wordpress), you can click icons to switch between different entrance types and view their corresponding resource metrics.
![Multiple entrances](/images/manual/olares/multiple-entrances.png){width=40%}
:::tip
* When your application list grows large, quickly locate specific applications by typing their names in the search box at the top of the page.
* Regularly checking resource consumption patterns helps you identify applications that might need optimization or attention.
