# Manage applications in Market

 Olares Market is an open and permissionless application platform. It provides one-click installation for a variety of applications and content recommendation algorithms from both Olares and third-party developers.

This guide helps users understand how to install, update, and uninstall applications through the Market. We'll also cover how to install custom applications.

## Before you begin
Before you start, it is recommended to familiarize yourself with a few concepts for Olares applications:

| Terminology                                                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| [Shared application](../concepts/application.md#cluster-scoped-applications) | A special category of community applications on Olares<br/> designed to provide unified, shared resources or services to all <br/>users within an Olares cluster. Only one <br/>instance is allowed per cluster. |

### Install shared and reference applications

To ensure a shared service is running and accessible within the cluster, follow this general installation process based on the type of Shared App:

* **Headless backend service**:
    This type of shared applications typically require third-party reference applications to access its service. Take Ollama for example:
    1. The administrator installs the shared application first. This makes the core service available in the cluster.
    
    2. Members (including the administrator) install the corresponding reference application (e.g., Open WebUI or LobeChat) to access the Ollama service.

* **Complete application with built-in UI**:
    This type of shared applications can provide service to itself. Typical examples are Dify Shared and ComfyUI Shared.
    
    1. The administrator installs the shared application first. This not only launches the shared service for the cluster, but also installs the client-side interface as the reference application.
    
       ::: tip ComfyUI Launcher
       ComfyUI Shared contains a web launcher component to facilitate the management of related services and resources. The administrator needs to configure and start the service from the ComfyUI Launcher.
       :::

    2. Other members in the cluster install the same application. For these users, only the access point to the shared application is installed.

### Install custom applications

To install a custom application:

1. Prepare an Olares Application Chart file (in `.zip`, `.tgz`, `.tar`, or `.gz` format).
2. Open **Market** from the Dock or Launchpad.
3. From the left sidebar, click **My Olares** > **Upload custom chart**, and select the chart file to install.

You can view all installed custom applications under the **My Olares** > **Upload** tab.

## Update applications
To update an application from Market:

1. Open Market from the Dock or Launchpad.
2. In the left sidebar, click **Updates** under the **Manage** section. If there are available updates, a notification badge will display.
3. The **Available updates** panel will display the applications with available updates.Click **Update all** to update all applications at once, or update each application individually.

* **Missing dependencies**: Check the **Dependency** section on the application details page and make sure all required apps are installed.
