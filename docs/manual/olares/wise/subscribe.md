# Subscribe and manage feeds
Wise offers flexible subscription options to help you follow your favorite content sources, including articles, blogs, podcasts, and video channels. This guide explains how to add and manage your subscriptions.

## Subscribe methods
:::tip
When you subscribe to podcast or video channels in Wise, new episodes automatically download to your Olares storage. This ensures your media content is always available—even offline—and protected from source deletion or unavailability.
