# Generate two-factor authentication codes
Two-factor authentication (2FA) requires both your password and an authentication code when signing in. These codes are generated using Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP), which creates temporary codes that refresh automatically. Similar to Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator, Vault can generate secure 2FA codes for your online accounts.

This guide explains how to generate two-factor authentication (2FA) codes in Vault.
## Prepare your target service
1. Log in to the website where you want to enable 2FA (e.g., GitHub or OpenAI).
2. Navigate to the security settings page and enable two-factor authentication using authenticator app.

3. Save the provided secret key or QR code for the next steps.

If the service provides recovery codes, store them securely. They are crucial to account recovery if you lose access to Vault.
