# Create and manage accounts

Managing Olares accounts is a core function of LarePass. If you are new to Olares, you will need to start by creating an Olares ID. This guide walks you through the process, and other commonly used account operations as well.

::: tip Note
Olares ID creation is only available on LarePass mobile.
:::

## Create an Olares ID

Before you start, ensure you have downloaded the [LarePass](https://larepass.olares.com) app on your phone. Depending on your personal preference, you can use one of the following options to create your Olares ID:

- **Quick creation**: Create an Olares ID by entering an available name that meets the requirements. This is the default mode.
- **Advanced creation**: Link an existing trusted identity (such as social accounts) with Olares ID using Verification Credentials (VC). This is for individual or organizational users who require enhanced security and more distinctive IDs or domains.

### Quick creation

To create an individual Olares ID quickly:

1. In LarePass app, tap **Create an account**. 

2. Enter your desired Olares ID. It must be at least 8 characters long and contain only lowercase letters and numbers.
3. Click **Continue** to finish the creation process.
