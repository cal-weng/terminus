# Manage integrations in LarePass

LarePass is your central hub for connecting Olares with third-party services like Google Drive, Dropbox, AWS S3, and Tencent COS. These integrations extend the capabilities of your Olares environment like file sync, secure backup, and more.

:::info
We're working on adding support for more third-party integrations that will connect you with more external services to your Olares account.

## Add a cloud drive via OAuth

OAuth-based integrations like Google Drive and Dropbox require initial setup via the LarePass mobile app:

1. Open LarePass on your mobile device.

2. Tap **Settings** > **LarePass settings** > **Integration**, then tap <i class="material-symbols-outlined">add</i> in the top-right corner.

## Add a cloud storage using API-keys

Services like AWS S3 and Tencent Cloud COS require setup using API keys (Access Key & Secret Key). You can do this directly from the LarePass app or from the **Integration** settings within Olares:

Alternatively, you can configure these integrations directly within [Olares Settings](/manual/olares/settings/integrations.md). 

Once authorized, you'll see the connected account in the integration list. You can select the storage for [Olares backup](../olares/settings/backup.md) or access the storage in **Files** > **Cloud Storage** in Olares.
