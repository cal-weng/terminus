# Access Olares anywhere via LarePass VPN

Enabling the LarePass VPN creates a secure, private connection to your Olares. It's the simplest and most reliable way to access your private applications and services from anywhere, guaranteeing both security and speed.

This document walks you through how to enable LarePass VPN.

## How access works in Olares

In Olares, you access applications & services via their dedicated URLs (e.g., `app.yourname.olares.com`). Depending on the intended accessibility, there are two types of entrances:

- **Public entrance**: Accessible to anyone with no authentication. For example, a blog page that you host on WordPress. Traffic is routed through Cloudflare Tunnel or FRP before reaching Olares.
- **Private entrance**: Intended only for you, such as Desktop, Vault, the management console of WordPress. There are two scenarios when accessing private entrances:

  - LarePass VPN enabled: Traffic is routed through VPN (TailScale) wherever you are.
  - LarePass VPN not enabled: Traffic routing is the same way as public entrances.   

::: warning Always enable VPN for private access
For the best experience with private entrances, we strongly recommend enabling the LarePass VPN. It ensures your connection is always encrypted, direct, and fast. 
:::

::: tip Note
Starting with Olares 1.12, you no longer need a separate `.local` address (e.g., `app.local.yourname.olares.cn`) for local access to private applications. The single address (e.g., `app.yourname.olares.cn`) now automatically provides a fast, direct connection to Olares when the LarePass VPN is active.

## Understand connection status
LarePass displays the connection status between your device and Olares, helping you understand or diagnose your current network connection.

![Connection status](/images/manual/larepass/connection-status.jpg)

| Status       | Description                                      |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Internet     | Connected to Olares via the public internet      |
| Intranet     | Connected to Olares via the local network        |
| FRP          | Connected to Olares via FRP                      |
| DERP         | Connected to Olares via VPN using DERP relay     |
| P2P          | Connected to Olares via VPN using P2P connection |
| Offline mode | Currently offline, unable to connect to Olares   |

::: info
When accessing private entrances from an external environment through VPN, if the status shows "DERP", it indicates that the VPN cannot directly connect to Olares via P2P and must use Tailscale's relay servers. This status may affect connection quality. If you constantly encounter this situation, please contact Olares support for assistance.

## Troubleshoot connection issues
If you encounter connection problems, LarePass will display diagnostic messages to help you resolve the issue. Here are some common scenarios and how to address them:
