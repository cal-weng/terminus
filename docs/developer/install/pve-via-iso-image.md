# Install Olares on PVE with ISO image
You can install Olares directly on Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE) using an ISO image. This guide walks you through downloading the Olares ISO, configuring PVE environment, completing the installation, and getting your Olares up and running.

:::warning Not recommended for production use
Currently, Olares on PVE has certain limitations. We recommend using it only for development or testing purposes.
:::

<!--@include: ./reusables.md{45,51}-->

## System requirements
Make sure your device meets the following requirements.

- CPU: At least 4 cores
- RAM: At least 8GB of available memory
- Storage: At least 200GB of available SSD storage
- Supported Systems: PVE 8.2.2

## Download Olares ISO image
Download the official Olares ISO image.

## Configure VM in PVE

To run Olares on PVE, make sure the VM is configured with the following settings. You can either apply them when **creating a new VM** or adjust an **existing VM** to match these requirements.

### Required VM settings

- OS:
  - `ISO image`: Select the official Olares ISO image you just downloaded.
- System:
  - `BIOS`: Select OVMF (UEFI).
  - `EFI Storage`: Choose a storage location (for example, a local LVM or directory) to store UEFI firmware variables.
  - `Pre-Enroll keys`: **Uncheck** the option to disable Secure Boot.
- Disks:
  - `Disk size (GiB)`: At least 200GB.
- CPU:
  - `Cores`: At least 4 cores

Below is a sample configuration for the VM hardware settings in PVE.

::: warning SSD required
The installation will likely fail if an HDD (mechanical hard drive) is used instead of an SSD.
:::

:::info Version compatibility
While the specific version is confirmed to work, the process may still work on other versions. Adjustments may be necessary depending on your environment. If you meet any issues with these platforms, feel free to raise an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/beclab/Olares/issues/new).
:::

## Install on PVE

1. Start the virtual machine (VM).
2. From the boot menu, select **Install Olares to Hard Disk**.
3. In the Olares System Installer, available disks will be listed. Enter the drive letter of the first disk as your target disk.

    - A warning will appear:

    ```bash
    WARNING: This will DESTROY all data on <your target disk>
    ```

    Type `yes` when prompted with `Continue? (yes/no):` to proceed.

   :::tip Note
   If the GPU passthrough is configured in PVE, the system will automatically install the graphics driver, and related warnings may appear, for example:
   ```bash
   WARNING: nvidia-installer was forced to guess the X Iibrary path 'usr/lib'and X module path ...
   ```
   If they appear, press **Enter** to ignore them.
   :::

4. Once the installation completes, you’ll see the message:

    ```
    Installation completed successfully!
    ```

    Press **Enter** and then use **CTRL + ALT + DEL** to reboot the VM.

## Verify installation

After the VM restarts, it will boot into the Ubuntu system. 
1. Log in to the Ubuntu using the default credentials:
    - Username: `olares`
    - Password: `olares`

2. Confirm that Olares has been installed successfully using the following command: 
     ```bash
     sudo olares-check
     ```

    The installation is successful if you see results like:

    ```bash
    ...
    check Olaresd:  success
    check Containerd:  success
    ```
