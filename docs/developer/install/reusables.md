For example, if your full Olares ID is `alice123@olares.com`:

- **Domain name**: Press `Enter` to use the default domain name or type `olares.com`.
- **Olares ID**: Enter the prefix of your Olares ID. In this example, enter `alice123`.

Upon completion of the installation, the initial system information, including the Wizard URL and the initial login password, will appear on the screen. You will need them later in the activation stage.
