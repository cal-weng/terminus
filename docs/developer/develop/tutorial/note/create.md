# How to Start Developing an Application

## Install and Launch Studio

1. Install [Studio](https://market.olares.com/app/studio) from the Olares Market.
2. Find the Studio icon in the launcher panel on the Olares Desktop.
3. Click on the icon to launch the application.

## Create Your App

Click the **Create a new application** to create a blank Olares application from a template.

- In the **App Name** field, enter your application name.
- Set the **APP type** to **app**.
- Change the **Main Entrance Port** for your APP entrance.
- In the **Image** field, input the image name and tag from your image repository where your app image will be stored.

## Setup App Config

After creating the application, you can see the Olares Application Chart files generated by Studio under the **Files** Tab. You can add, delete, or rename various configuration files as needed.

### Chart.yaml

The `Chart.yaml` file is a required file in the Helm Chart specification. It contains the application's `Name` and `Chart Version`. You can [learn more here](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/). For now, we're not going to change the default `Chart.yaml` yet.

### OlaresManifest.yaml

In the `OlaresManifest.yaml `file, you can change many configurations. This includes but is not limited to:

- Changing the app's title, icon, and other details
- Adding system `middleware`
- Getting `permissions` for system directory access
- Changing the `required and limited resource` of the app

#### Adding a [cluster database middleware](../../package/manifest.md#middleware)

![config app](/images/developer/develop/tutorial/create/olares-manifest.jpg)

In this example, we will configure a PostgreSQL database. Add the following content to the configuration file:

```Yaml
middleware:
  postgres:
    username: postgres
    databases:
    - name: db
      distributed: false
```

You can specify your database `username` and `password` in the configuration. Alternatively, you can leave these fields empty and use the system-generated random password instead. You need to set the database `name` required by your APP. In addition, you can also choose to apply for a `distributed database`. If so, the system will create a [citus](https://github.com/citusdata/citus) database for you.

After completing the configuration, you can reference the corresponding database configuration in your `deployment.yaml`. For example, reference in the environment variables of the container.

```yaml
- env:
    - name: DB_PORT
      value: "{{ .Values.postgres.port }}"
    - name: DB_NAME
      value: "{{ .Values.postgres.databases.demo }}"
    - name: DB_USER
      value: "{{ .Values.postgres.username }}"
    - name: DB_HOST
      value: "{{ .Values.postgres.host }}"
    - name: DB_PWD
      value: "{{ .Values.postgres.password }}"
```

- `.Values.postgres.username`: the `username` of PostgreSQL in configuration.
- `.Values.postgres.databases.demo`: the `database name` in configuration.
- `.Values.postgres.password`: the `password` in configuration.
- `.Values.postgres.host`: the database service address specified by the system for the APP.
- `.Values.postgres.port`: the database service port specified by the system for the APP.

::: warning
These parameters should not be hardcoded, they must reference the variables passed in by the system, and the system will randomize the database information in the configuration.
:::

#### Adding [Access Permissions to the File System](../../package/manifest.md#permission)

To read and save files in the Olares system, we need to configure Access Permissions for certain file directories. These directories can be specified in the `Permissions` section of the `OlaresManifest.yaml` file:

- `appData`: This applies for independent cloud storage space for the app.
- `appCache`: This applies for local disk data cache space, usually on an SSD disk, for the app.
- `userData`: This applies for access permission to the user's data directory. List the directories you need to access here.

After completing the above configuration, you can reference these configurations in your deployment

```yaml
volumes:
  - hostPath:
      path: "{{ .Values.userspace.appCache }}/demo"
      type: DirectoryOrCreate
    name: appcache
  - hostPath:
      path: "{{ .Values.userspace.appData }}/demo"
      type: DirectoryOrCreate
    name: appdata
```

- `.Values.userspace.appCache` is the `appCache` directory
- `.Values.userspace.appData` is the `appData` directory
- `.Values.userspace.userData` is the `userData` directory

### deployment.yaml

The `deployment.yaml` in the `templates` folder details the deployment configuration of your application.

If your app includes several containers, such as front-end and back-end, you can add multiple containers in the `deployment.yaml` file in the `templates`. Studio will recognize these different containers and bind each of them separately to different development containers. For example:

```yaml
containers:
  # front-end container
  - env:
      - name: PGID
        value: "1000"
      - name: PUID
        value: "1000"
      - name: TZ
        value: Etc/UTC
    image: bytetrade/demo-app:0.0.1
    name: demo
    ports:
      - containerPort: 8080
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: "1"
        memory: 2000Mi
      requests:
        cpu: 50m
        memory: 1000Mi
    volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: /appcache
        name: appcache

  # Server container
  - env:
      - name: DB_PORT
        value: "{{ .Values.postgres.port }}"
      - name: DB_NAME
        value: "{{ .Values.postgres.databases.demo }}"
      - name: DB_USER
        value: "{{ .Values.postgres.username }}"
      - name: DB_HOST
        value: "{{ .Values.postgres.host }}"
      - name: DB_PWD
        value: "{{ .Values.postgres.password }}"
      - name: PGID
        value: "1000"
      - name: PUID
        value: "1000"
      - name: TZ
        value: Etc/UTC
    image: bytetrade/demo-server:0.0.1
    name: server
    ports:
      - containerPort: 9000
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: "1"
        memory: 1000Mi
      requests:
        cpu: 50m
        memory: 500Mi
    volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: /appcache
        name: appcache
      - mountPath: /appdata
        name: appdata
```

## Bind Container

After configuring the above details, navigate to the **Containers** page to bind the development container(**Dev Container**) for this app. Once done, you can start coding.

![containers](/images/developer/develop/tutorial/create/bind.jpg)

You can set a specified development environment for the bound **Dev Container**. Currently, Studio supports `NodeJS`, `Golang`, and `Python` **Dev Container**. Let's bind a `NodeJS` **Dev Container** to the demo frontend container and a `Golang` **Dev Container** to the server container.

We create a new **Dev Container** here. If you have previously created an unbound **Dev Container**, you can also choose an existing container for binding here.

![bind container](/images/developer/develop/tutorial/create/bind-2.jpg)

## Install App

After binding the **Dev Container**, click **Install** in the upper right corner to install the development app into the system. Once the installation status shifts from `Processing` to `Running`, it indicates that the app is installed and ready for coding.

![installing](/images/developer/develop/tutorial/create/installing.jpg)

Then, navigate back to the **Containers** page. You'll notice that the **Open IDE button** is now enabled. Press this button to access the **Dev Container** and begin coding in the actual environment.
