# Develop Frontend Program

## Preview App
After installing the app, you can preview the frontend of your application using the **Preview** button in **Studio**.

## Open IDE

When you open the frontend **Dev Contain IDE, you'll see the welcome page. From this point, the steps are like those for [backend development](backend.md). You can clone your frontend code using the Terminal.

::: tip
In this example, the frontend and backend use the same code directory. So, after you've cloned the code for the backend, you don't need to do it again.

After cloning the code, if you are working on a Node project, you might need to make some configuration changes.

- **Vite Configuration Changes**

  If your frontend project uses **Vite**, you need to add an **HMR** configuration. In development mode, **Vite** initiates a **WebSocket** to receive code reload notifications from the server. The default **WebSocket** port matches the server's startup port. However, if the development app uses an **Nginx proxy** it will operate on the default port 443. Therefore, some modifications are required.
  
  Modify the `vite.config.js` file as follows:
  ```js
  export default defineConfig({
    server: {
      hmr: {
        clientPort: 443,
      },
    },
  });
  ```  
- **Nginx Configuration Changes**
  
  After setting up your project's development environment, you need to modify the Nginx configuration. Open `/etc/nginx/conf.d/dev/dev.conf` and make the necessary changes:
  ```nginx
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9000;
    proxy_set_header            Host $http_host;
    proxy_set_header            X-real-ip $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header            X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection $http_connection;
    proxy_set_header Accept-Encoding gzip;
  }
  ```

  Then, reload Nginx:
  ```sh
  nginx -s reload
  ```
## Run Dev Mode
After completing the **Nginx** configuration, you can start your frontend program in dev mode and preview your APP in Olares.

```sh
npm run dev
```

If you need to set up a backend api proxy for the frontend, you can modify the proxy configuration in **Nginx**.

```nginx
location /api/ {
      proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9001;
      proxy_set_header            Host $http_host;
      proxy_set_header            X-real-ip $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header            X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection $http_connection;
      proxy_set_header Accept-Encoding gzip;
}
```
